I'm a big fan of Gmail shortcuts, here's how to make them usable with the [Colemak](http://www.colemak.com) keyboard layout:

First, if you haven't already done so, you will need to enable keyboard shortcuts. In Gmail click the cog in the top right and then click 'Mail Settings'. Then select 'Keyboard shortcuts on' and save.

Next, click 'Labs' at the top of your settings page. Find 'Custom keyboad shortcuts' then enable it and save. 

You will then have a new item at the top of your settings page called 'Keyboard Shortcuts', select this and follow my configuration below or tweak it to your liking.

* Back to threadlist : change from u to h
* Newer conversation : change from k to u
* Older conversation : change from j to e
* Previous message : change from p to n
* Next message : change from n to i
* Archive : change from e to E
* Archive and go to the previous conversation : add alternative ,
